MARKET TIMING STRATEGY

Construct a market timing strategy according to the principles laid out in the article "Market timing: Sin a little resolving the valuation timing puzzle. Journal of Investment Management, 15(3), 23-40.":

a. Strategy allocates between 50%-150% of portfolio market value at a given rebalance date to equities; the remaining part is held in cash (earning UK 1M Libor)

b. At each (monthly) rebalancing date the strategy allocates to equities based on the strength of the tactical signal defined as the difference between the E/P ratio (inverse of P/E) and its rolling median scaled by the 95-5 percentile range; the equity weight is therefore: 100% + (current E/P â€“ median E/P)/(95-5 percentile range).

c. Compare the results of the above strategy to one that simply holds the underlying broad market index.
